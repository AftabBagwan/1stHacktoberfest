    "description": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

    "description": "There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc."

    "description": "Contributing to Open - source software and projects can appear to be an intimidating task. Your favored search engine will yield a whole slew of resources for getting started, including instructions and repositories. Nevertheless, many times your search does not return the desired results, and even after reading many blog articles, you still do not know how to contribute to Open Source. The tainted legacy of certain enterprises, as well as a scathing undertone, do not assist matters and may further complicate issues. I've been there before. I looked and looked for outstanding Open Source repositories to contribute to, only to discover that I had no idea where to begin. I began focused on other tasks because I was frustrated and disillusioned. Finally, I myself contributed to few Python Projects, CPP, Java DSA ProgramsÂ that were marked (help-wanted) (hacktoberfest-2021). Felt excited and looking forward for more such contributions."
